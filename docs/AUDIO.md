# Audio

Fieldwork uses one browser audio service for board moves and practice feedback.
Audio is presentation only: it never grades a move,
advances a session, changes the engine budget or infers a tactic from the board.
The bundled selection is the owner's mixed recording set, listed below. The
separate audio studio previews those same sounds in isolation and in context.
Rejected auditions and their selection/export UI have been removed.

## Controls and defaults

**Settings → Sound** contains the master switch, volume,
board/practice switches and an explicit test button. Defaults are sound
enabled, volume 35%, and board and practice enabled.
Account preferences use the existing owned `user_preferences` row, including the
reserved local user. A failed initial preference load keeps audio silent until
retried. Audio changes do not overwrite coach or motion choices.

The shared board workspace has a quick mute control. It applies to the current
account on this browser/device, persists locally, and synchronizes across tabs
through the storage event. It does not change the account's sound settings on
other devices. Stored mute is an enhancement; if browser storage is unavailable,
mute still works for the current page.

Audio is independent of both animation settings and reduced motion. Browser
autoplay permission is separate from Fieldwork preferences: the service unlocks
from a trusted interaction, remains silent if blocked, and never queues blocked
sounds to surprise the user later. Hidden tabs stop playback. Reopening a tab
does not replay missed events. All feedback remains understandable without sound.

## Selected sounds

| Cues | Owner's selection |
| --- | --- |
| Move, capture, castle, promotion, checkmate | Soft objects |
| Check, correct answer, completion | Tabletop |
| Try again | Muted tongue drum |

All nine cues now have owner-approved sounds. `productionCuePalettes` is the
single per-cue default mapping. A null selection remains supported and suppresses
playback before a download or timer is created. The studio uses these same
defaults without reading or changing account preferences.
Ratings never have sounds: their cue types, emitters, assets, settings and saved
preference have been removed. The forward database migration drops only the
retired `audio_review` column and preserves remaining account preferences.

## Cue policy

| Cue | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Move / capture / castle / promotion | One committed or explicitly inspected board move |
| Check / mate | The server-supplied move notation contains check/checkmate; these take precedence over ordinary placement |
| Correct | The current practice attempt was accepted by its existing answer authority |
| Retry | A rejected practice attempt; the approved muted tongue drum follows the attempted move |
| Complete | A puzzle or lesson has just completed; replaces the ordinary correct cue |

No move classification triggers a sound. Checkmate in a
historical game has a neutral finish, rather than implying the learner won.
Revealing an answer plays the board cue without a success reward. A correct
opening rehearsal is an accepted authored answer, not a claim of objective Best.

Game review navigation emits only on deliberate actions. A single forward step
uses the server SAN; backward or multi-ply jumps use a neutral placement. Timeline
dragging is silent until release, with at most one neutral cue; cancellation does
not commit a sound. Initial loads, page reloads, board flips, return-to-game,
background refinement and analysis polling are silent. An uncached variation
step sounds only after its matching position response is accepted; failed or
superseded navigation stays silent. Completed variation analysis is silent.

Study playback sounds track explicitly displayed frames. Still mode collapses a
continuation to the visible final move without a burst of skipped sounds. Reset,
retry, navigation and unmount cancel queued audio. Saved feedback restored by GET
never counts as a fresh attempt. Cold practice emits no answer/evaluation hints
before an attempt or reveal permits feedback.

## Ownership and lifecycle

- `frontend/src/audio/model.ts` owns semantic cue, preference and prepared-speech
  types. `cueForMove` interprets canonical server SAN, not FEN or local chess rules.
- `catalog.ts` owns cue categories, priorities, approved production choices,
  palette metadata, per-cue asset availability and asset URLs. Engine and studio
  validate cue/palette pairs against it; each cue has one approved asset.
- `engine.ts` owns a lazily created Web Audio context, decoded asset cache, master
  gain, separate effects/speech buses, bounded playback, short cancellation fades,
  duplicate suppression, visibility and disposal. Suppressed requests are dropped.
- `AudioProvider.tsx` lives inside the existing account boundary and reuses
  `useSavedPreferences`. `useAudioScope` gives session hooks stable play/move/cancel
  methods and cancels their work on scope changes or unmount. The Board and coach
  artwork do not play sounds based on render effects.
- Session command handlers emit feedback after their existing generation guards.
  Display-only playback handlers emit move cues. Explicit replays get fresh event
  identities; deduplication does not globally suppress repeated chess positions.

The nine approved WAVs use **six CC0 source recordings**: chess pieces, bronze
bell, music box, triangle, glass and steel tongue drum. They are trimmed, level
matched and faded; castling combines two recorded hits. These are the exact
owner-approved files, with no new DSP or oscillator tones. Unselected recordings
and their unused recipes/credits have been removed from the current tree; earlier
auditions remain in Git history.

The Freesound inputs are public HQ MP3 previews rather than original WAV downloads.
The other inputs are the publisher's downloadable MP3s. Resaving them as WAV does
not restore information removed by MP3 encoding.

`frontend/src/audio/assets/sources.json` records each retained source, author,
license, input/output hash and exact edit recipe. Its license map and asset README
retain attribution alongside `CC0-1.0.txt`. `scripts/prepare_audio.py --check`
verifies assets offline; explicit authoring can reproduce the edits from
hash-checked source files. The nine WAVs total **765,450 bytes** (about 0.77 MB).
Assets are bundled locally, fetched and decoded only as needed; normal
installation/build/playback does not contact a sound provider. Additional
palettes need not change event producers.

## Audio studio

From the repository root:

```sh
npm --prefix frontend run dev:audio
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5176**. This is a separate Vite process with no account/API
connection and no production navigation route. It uses the actual audio engine
and the same nine approved defaults as the app.

- Play each sound alone; open its Source disclosure for the recording, author,
  edits and license. Exact recipes remain in the asset manifest.
- For Try again, choose **One retry**, **Repeated attempts** (default) or
  **Full sound mix**, then press **In context**. The longer previews repeat
  retries or include capture, check, correct and completion over about ten seconds.
  Retry/correct follow moves by 160ms, matching lesson playback. Switching context
  cancels playback and waits for another press.
- Play short board/practice scenarios with the approved set. Adjust volume,
  mute, stop or inspect playback history. Pending cues remain cancellable and do
  not preload or play early; the engine bounds delayed cues at 15 seconds.

There is no audition picker, selection storage or export UI. Obsolete studio
browser data is neither read nor rewritten. Playback never changes account
preferences. The studio shares application buttons and choice controls but owns
its layout. Its style boundary rejects application/board styles. CI has a
dedicated audio suite; audio-only changes do not require the coach artwork matrix.

## Coach speech foundation

`PreparedSpeechClip` accepts an already prepared `AudioBuffer` plus the existing
`CoachUtterance`, scope and event identity. The engine has a cancellable speech
bus, respects priority/interruptibility when replacing speech, and lowers effects
while speech plays. This is an extension point, not a production voice feature.

A future speech adapter owns obtaining a clip and checking whether an utterance
is still current before submitting it. The calling policy decides whether speech
is manual or permitted by `autoSpeakSuitable`. Visible/spoken text remains owned
by dialogue; audio never rewrites chess claims or generates character prose.
There is no TTS provider, voice catalogue, speech setting, automatic narration or
network speech request in this release.

## Verification

Engine tests cover cue precedence, mute/categories, activation failure, duplicates,
delayed and stale decoding, cancellation, hidden tabs, bounded voices, prepared
speech and disposal. Browser tests observe actual Web Audio source starts and
cover the production preference/session/navigation paths without production test
globals. Studio tests exercise all approved assets, source coverage, context timing and cancellation.
Run the affected application/account suites alongside the dedicated audio suite
when changing integration. See [Testing](TESTING.md) and the dated
[verification record](VERIFICATION.md) for commands and actual results.
